UI Frameworks are not simple. In fact, they can be almost as complicated to learn as a new programming language. 
Given that, why bother to use something like Semantic UI? What does one get in return for the investment of time and 
frustration? Why not just use raw HTML and CSS? Are the software engineering benefits of UI frameworks?

# These are the Questions that Haunt Me...
UI Frameworks are not simple and can be almost as complicated as learning a new programming language. As a beginner in using Semantic UI, I fell in love with creating designs of websites, but in return, I acquired a lot of frustration. What kind of menu was I supposed to make? How am I supposed to put a button over an image?
