  Have you ever had a passion to achieve something, that you know it is not the right path to follow? While I was growing up, I wanted to be apart the health field, so I joined the health career pathway in high school. I didn't like the image of blood so why did I have such a passion for the health field. 
  I grew up playing video games and games on the computer, but I did not think of having a career into the computer field until after graduation. I decided to go through with computer science because I was always interested in computers and games. I was always the one my parents called when they had a problem with their computers, that's where my love for computers started. 
  When I started my journey of being a computer science major, I found myself frustrated and stressed out because learning how to code was a whole new different language. There were times where I wanted to give up and change my major, but the excitement of figuring out a program is always the goal. 
  It surprises me how computer science not only has learning situations, but also real world situations. Software engineering interests me in this way because aside from coding, we learn critical thinking and communication skills. We learn how to think under pressure and gain problem solving skills. In relation to the real world, there is always a process to approach solutions. There are always obstacles that we are going to face. 
  I hope to have the skills to become more efficient and faster when it comes to writing down a code. With my interest of career in software engineering and web development, I want to get the knowledge of how the skills I will learn will be inmportant for my future career. I am interested in becoming apart of the new advancements that allows technology to grow. The advances in technology motivate me to follow the quote "failure leads to success." Although we have a lot of failure to create our programs, the success at the end of it is always worth it.
