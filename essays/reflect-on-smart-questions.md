how the chosen questions fulfill (or not) the precepts for smart questions,

## Intelligence Starts with YOU
Throughout high school and college years, every single one of us have listened to someone ask an easy questions, 
then having to hear it again, but rephrased. The easy questions would be the ones that just need the answer right away, versus the smarter ones show more effort in learning. Asking stupid questions can lead to wasting other individuals' time just because you were lazy to figure it out on your own. In the programming world, we are all being introduced to new opportunities. Smart questions are important for software engineers because we are all racing against time to finish a program by a certain time or figure out why our codes are not working. Not everyone has a huge amount of time to help others with basic questions that lack information.
