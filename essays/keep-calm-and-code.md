# Keep Calm and Code

### Just a Code Away
While others may think coding standards can help you learn programming language, you may think of coding standards as how many spaces to indent or where you put your curly braces. Coding, to me, is like learning a different language, for instance, Spanish. Forgetting an accent on a letter may create a different word or that word may not exist at all. Meanwhile, forgetting a comma in a list of numbers or mispelling a word in a code can lead to either an unexpected outcome, or the program exploding with errors. 

I believe that coding standards are able to help us learn a programming language by keeping everything consistent. Coding standards allow individuals to organize their code, which eventually help them figure out where any possible error will be located. The consistency of someones code helps to improve the quality of what the code looks like. For example, a consistent code may be easier to read and make changes to certain parts of the code that do not look right. 

### First Impressions
Using ESLint was a helpful tool that I used in IntelliJ. ESLint included checking for errors and checking the style of code. I found this tool helpful to in organizing code and making sure that that are no errors in the code. Rather than not having a tool to help look for errors in code, ESLint allows a second hand of help to figure out where an individual may have gone wrong with their code. The ESLint plugin acts as a time saver for someone who is struggling to find out where they went wrong. 

Compared to JSFiddle, IntelliJ provides a more organized way of creating a program. By allowing us to connect with GitHub repositories and create new Javascript files, IntelliJ has showed me how influencial different coding programs can be. JSFiddle was a hassle to use because not all the code would be saved right away and there was no second-hand help with where our errors were. The problem I had with JSFiddle was mostly how I spelt certain words, but it would go unoticed without ESLint. Even if I find IntelliJ more organized and helpful with creating programs, I prefer the location of the console in JSFiddle because using the index.html and switching windows can take up some time.
