### Broken Yet Holding On
   A few years ago, my cousin and I were in the back of my grandpa's pickup truck; the rain was pouring down on us like rocks. Unfortunately, we only had one big umbrella to share, which we struggled to keep from breaking in the wind. As I thought to myself, "why did we think it would be an amazing idea to ride in the back of a pickup truck with rain coming down as fast the speed of light?," within seconds, we adjusted our grip and the umbrella broke. I remember my grandpa getting upset because that was his most useful umbrella, which was none destroyed.
   
### Rain, Rain, Go Away
   Umbrellas come in all shapes and sizes, some wind resistant and some that are not. As umbrellas protect us from the rain, we know that we can always go into the rain without it, which have its consequences. As a programmer, we get rained down information and conflicts when working with codes, just like how the clouds throw their rain down upon us. My cousin and I took a risk when we used the new umbrella in strong winds, like how programmers take risks using different design patterns. If one breaks, another one is opened up. My grandpa's disappointment reminded me of the disappointment of not finishing a code or trying to learn another design pattern because the previous one did not work out well for you. 
  Learning about different design patterns and how to implement them may lead to stressful conflicts, but it is an aid to protect me from the errors and code conflicts that I may face. I have always wondered what we are trying to learn when it came to different coding languages. I beleive that it did not matter what language we chose to program in, but the designn patterns that supported me to obtain efficiency. 
  Why should we use umbrellas when we have jackets with hoodies? Like design patterns, I believe that you must carry an extra weight to fulfill your goal. Wearing a simple jacket will not protect me from the rain as much as an umbrella would. No matter how hard the rain is, how difficult the code is, I will be sure that I am carrying my umbrella everywhere I go.
