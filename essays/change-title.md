A common interview question is “What are design patterns?”, followed by “What design patterns have you used in your own code?”

For this technical essay, you will write an interesting and informative technical essay that ends up answering these two
questions. By doing so, you’ll be better prepared to answer this question if it comes up in an interview.

Do not, under any circumstances, write two paragraphs, one with the title “What are design patterns?” and one with the title 
“How I have used them in my code.” That will get you no points, as such an essay would be too boring for anyone to read.

Instead, write an essay, perhaps using metaphor or analogy, which by its conclusion has answered these two questions but 
in a clever, interesting, and informative fashion.


Notes
a design pattern describees a bproblem that occurs over and over again in our environment and then describes the core of the solution to that problem in such a way that you can use this soltution a million times over without ever doing it the same way twice.

Example: design pattern of roofs

Design patterns in software developement
- Design patterns are a general reusuable solution to a commonly occuring problem in software design
- a design patttern in a template that can be used in many different situations
- OO Design Patterns show relationships and interactions between classes or objects without satisfying the final application classes or object
