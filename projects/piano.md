Pianos and other musical instruments may not be physically related to computer science, however, the thought process is. I have learned that when learning a new song on the piano, it requires a considerable amount of time and patience. There will always be times where I fail and constantly press the wrong key or forget how to play the next day, but eventually with more practice I will succeed.

Computer Science relates to learning how to play the piano. Learning new code requires a significant amount of time, especially for those who lack experience in it, like me. There are times when I just want to quit, but I have learned that each time you fail on figuring out a program, the closer you get to success. Eventually I will figure out the song and complete it just like how will figure out a program and complete the codes.
