summary: A summary of my community service experiences and how it relates to Computer Science.
---

During my junior year of high school, I started doing community services that involved cleaning up parks and schools and assisting elderly patients and disabled children. In the park clean ups, all the volunteers were seperated into different areas, like the playgrounds or the tree areas. Each group had various tasks to accomplish until the end of the day. Since we were in a public park, a few obstacles were encountered, but teamwork solved the problem. 

Community service plays a big factor in leadership, communication, and teamwork skills. Just like community service, these skills make it easier to accomplish goals in computer science. Especially for beginners, computer science shares a whole new different language of code and critical thinking. I have learned that it is important to communicate with others and work in groups, especially when you don't know what you're doing.
