# About [UH Bazaar](http://uhbazaar.meteorapp.com/#/)


UH Bazaar is a Meteor application that aims to provide a localized marketplace for the University of Hawaii at Manoa
community, which accomadates buying, selling and trading goods.  UH Bazaar aims to provide a comfortable experience for
students by keeping the exchanges on campus and between students.  With the tides of incoming and outgoing students,
whether graduating or just returning home for the summer, there is a wealth of commodity in need of a custom tailored
facilitation to manage exchange.  To help facilitate secure exchange, UH Bazaar intends to implement the UH CAS login system
to enforce student-student interaction, as well as a goods map for convenient navigation on campus.

### UH Bazaar looks to make being a student just a little less stressful.

This landing page is to be implemented as a type of 'flyer' for informing users about what exactly our application is, as
well as containing informaition on functionality and a projected date for a beta release.  Meteor Galaxy will be the means
through which the application will be hosted, the hope is to have the application hosted as soon as possible.  Updates are to
follow.

# Community Feedback

Uh Bazaar was tested by a handful of students from UH Manoa, here's what they had to say...

**Shawn M.**

> Easy to Follow the onscreen prompts, nice site design. Categories page makes it easy to look for items.  Maybe create a confirmation  page after completing the creation of account.  A page with featured items would be appealing.  Expand the homepage; more explanation to potential customers.

**Ramsey A.**

>The website is easy to navigate, the transitions between pages are smooth, easy to read font and size.  No popping or distracting colors, plain and simple.  Maybe make the menu bar a bit more noticeable, greet the customer after login screen.

**Ilm M.** 

> The webpage is smooth all over, it's easy to access the tabs.  Nice background! Maybe make the menu bar bigger and eye popping to get attention, more colors.

**Aaron B. had this to say:**

> UH Bazaar was user-friendly and quick to learn. Everything is straightforward making navigation and posting easy. I can't wait to see it functioning with more members. Truly an ingenious idea, combining the college student lifestyle with practicality to streamline a campus need.

allow for functional site in minimal time. This included

- Landing page
- User Home Page
- Admin Home Page
- User profile / edit profile page
- Category / Categories page
- List item page
- Create item page
- Notify admin page

## [Milestone 2](https://github.com/uhbazaar/uhbazaar/projects/3): Functional Implementation

Milestone 2 realized most of the basic functionaloty expected out of UH Bazaar.  The application became a
minimum viable product for user testing.

Milestone 2 began on Novemeber 15, 2018 and was completed on November 28, 2018.

## [Milestone 3](https://github.com/uhbazaar/uhbazaar/projects/4): Beyond the Basics

**Tips regarding Bcrypt warning.**
The following message will display when you run this app...
```asp
Note: you are using a pure-JavaScript implementation of bcrypt.
While this implementation will work correctly, it is known to be
approximately three times slower than the native implementation.
In order to use the native implementation instead, run

  meteor npm install --save bcrypt

in the root directory of your application.
```
Installing bcrypt can lead to some real headaches if your using a Windows machine.  If your running macOS or Linux, your 
windows friends will stop talking to you. Bcrypt doesn't tell you this, but I will. Bcrypt is only used in Meteor for password 
checking, meaning performance impacts are not at all noticeable with a small user-base.

**That's it!**
You are now ready to start contributing to UH Bazaar!

## Github Workflow
#### A useful walkthrough for getting familiar with how to contirbute using pull requests!

### Phase 1
#### Set up
- Fork the "Main" repository (i.e. UHBazaar) to your personal Github account
  *You can do this by going to your organization's GitHub repository and clicking on fork (top right corner)*
- Clone that repo to a local directory.
- Open your command-line and cd into the local repo.
- Now add your organizations main repo as a remote called "upstream."
```bash
git remote add upstream "url of your organizations main repo"
```
- Now set the remote url as origin to your forked version of upstream.
```bash
git remote set-url origin "url of your forked repo"
```
- Type this
```bash
git remote -v
```
- You should see something like this
```bash
origin	https://github.com/zakgilbert/uhbazaar.github.io.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/zakgilbert/uhbazaar.github.io.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/uhbazaar/uhbazaar.github.io.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/uhbazaar/uhbazaar.github.io.git (push)
```
- Notice the main repo is named upstream and your personal forked repo is named origin.

### Phase  2
#### Editing Code and Creating a pull request
-First create an issue in your organizations github project repo.
<img src="images/issueCreated.png"/>
- Open your command line and cd into your personal forked directory.
- Now we have to pull from the upstream master branch and push it to your personal origin master branch.  Otherwise you won't be working with the most current version of upstream master. This must be done evey time before making a new branch. Also you should only enter these next two commands when in your local master branch.
```bash
git checkout master     //switch to master branch
git pull --rebase upstream master
git push -f origin master
```
- Now create a branch make sure you remembered the number your issue was givin when you created it.
```bash
git branch pull-request-Issue-"insert issue number"
```
- Now switch to that branch
```bash
git checkout pull-request-Issue-"insert issue number"
```

### Phase 3
#### Commiting and creating a pull request
- Once you are satisfyed with your work on the branch you've created. Within that current branch add and commit your changes, then push like this.
```bash
git push origin "branch name"
```
- Now access your organizations main repo and create a pull request.
<img src="images/pullRequest1.png"/>

- Create new pull request.
- Click on the compare across forks option.
- Your base fork should be the main project repo and the head fork should be your personal fork.
<img src="images/pullRequest2.png"/>
- Create the pull request so your team mates can review it, before they pull it to the main repo.
